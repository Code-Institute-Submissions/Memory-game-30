<h2>Typography</h2>

<p style="color:red;">Tangerine</p>
the main font is Tangerine
 </p>
 Tangerine is a calligraphy font inspired by many italic chancery hands from the 16-17th century. Its tall ascender, the most distinct characteristic of this type, takes a wide line space between lines and gives it a graceful texture. It is generally advisable to use Tangerine for a title or short text at large size because of the short height of lowercase letters. Tangerine is produced by Japanese type designer Toshi Omagari and was named after a woman who encouraged him to begin this work.

<p style="color:red;">serif</p>
serifs are the small lines or strokes at the ends of the main strokes of the letters in a particular font. Sometimes, serifs are also descriptively explained as “hooks” or “little feet” at the ends of the vertical and horizontal strokes of a letter. Consequently, fonts with serifs are usually mentioned as Serif fonts, for example, Times Roman, Garamond, Souvenir, etc.

 imagery is important as the main purpose of the game is card matching
