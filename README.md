  ### Desgin
     ### Color Scheme

  The main color is white for the background the color of the text is red for the header ,moves and timer  
  the reason i chose white is because i didn't want the players of the game to be distracted by the background color 
  so i kept the color plain


### Imagery
 
 Imagery is important in this Website as player can memorise maps of
 different countries of the world users can engage with the website better
 if they have images to look at it makes the site more appealling to users
 i choose countires of the world card matching memory game.because its different
 and it could peek users interest in different countries of the world the site is 
 desgined to challenge peoples memory by trying to match the cards in the least amount
 of time and the least amount of flips possible.
