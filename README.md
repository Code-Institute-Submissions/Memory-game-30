  <h2>Desgin</h2>

  Color Scheme:

  The main color is white for the background the color of the text is red for the header ,moves and timer the stars are a green
  the reason i chose white is because i didn't want the players of the game to be distracted by the background color 


<h2>Imagery</h2>
 
 imagery is important as the main purpose of the game site.
 users can engage with the website better if they have images 
 to look at. i choose countires of the world  card matching
 memory game. I used countries of the world because people 
 can look a the maps of the different counties and try to 
 remember where they are on the game
